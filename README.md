# About me 👩🏽‍💻

Not so active at the moment, doing [RLHF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning_from_human_feedback) with a new human being. 🐣

I am a Machine Learning engineer and architect of end-to-end solutions, focused on NLP and Graph Learning. 
My current goals are to become a better technical writer and continue contributing to Open Source projects.

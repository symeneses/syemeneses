# About me 👩🏽‍💻


I am a Machine Learning engineer and architect of end-to-end solutions, especially for data-intensive products. 
My current focus is Graph Learning (and I believe everything is a graph 😉), NLP and education products. I enjoy working with designers 👨🏽‍🎨, developers 🧑🏻‍💻, and DevOps 🏗️ to build features users love.
